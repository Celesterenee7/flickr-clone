# Flickr Clone
#### Rails Authentication and Authorization for Epicodus
#### By Celeste Renee Morton
## Description:
The concept for this project is to make an app that lets users upload their photos to share with the world (like Flickr!)

## User Stories:
* Users create accounts
* Users can add, edit, delete images (but only their own)
* Users can add, edit, delete tags for all images
* Users can tag each other in images (to start simple, you may choose to display a list of all the users in a drop-down menu when you add a tag)
* Users have a profile page (users#show) with a list of all the photos they are tagged in
* Users can "favorite" images; include image favorites on profile page
* Users can add, edit, delete comments to images
